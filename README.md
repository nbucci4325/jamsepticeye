# jamsepticeye

https://itch.io/jam/jamsepticeye

Jam starts Oct 1, ends Oct 5. Submission is done via the link above. If it makes it easier I already have an itch profile so I could submit on behalf of us all and just put the credit to all of us in the game desc. (much like I did last time).

This project is a team effort submitted by 10 university students in their second year of school.
